# School Timetable Bot

A discord bot made during the online learning of 2020 to notify users of period changes, fetch timetabled classes, and store upcoming assignments in a public 'billboard'.

Utilised webscraping and automation of the school's student search API to monitor period changes and fetch timetabled classes, and a postgreSQL database to store the billboard.

Sadly stopped working-- the school started requiring authentication when requesting student timetable info.
